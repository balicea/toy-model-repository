This is the toy model repository, a companion to the paper "Toy Models for Macroevolutionary Patterns and Trends", under development at the journal Biosystems. There are thirteen classes of model, each of which has associated Matlab code:

1.	Daisyworld
2.	Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
3.	Ladders and Spectra, Toy Models as Scenarios
4.	The tree of life
5.	Adaptive Ratchets and Differentiation Trees
6.	Bio-Phenomenological-Mathematical Hybrid Models
7.	The Red Queen hypothesis
8.	The fitness landscape
9.	Nonlinear avalanches and evolutionary trends 
10.	Coupled avalanches and evolutionary dynamics
11.	Self-organized adaptive change
12.	Grounded branching processes
13.	Intentionally false models to capture evolutionary transience
